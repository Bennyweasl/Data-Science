Sci., Urbana, IL\\nLines: 95\\n\\nHaving run completely out of time, I\\'ve got to get my prophesies and\\npredictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse\\nfinishes in last year\\'s prediction contest.\\n\\nAL East -- 1993\\n\\n1.  Baltimore Orioles\\nWhy the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to\\nthis:\\n  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.\\n  -- Can\\'t bring myself to pick the Yankees\\n  -- Milwaukee was a fluke\\n  -- Indians aren\\'t ready to contend\\n  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn\\'t get any better\\n  -- Detroit\\'s pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\"\\n\"But you don\\'t really think the Orioles will win, do you.\"  No.  As a matter\\nof fact, I can\\'t see any team in the American League winning either division\\non paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-\\nbody has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \"You don\\'t really think that Brady\\nAnderson is going to repeat, do you?\"  No.  I\\'m basing the Orioles prediction\\non the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \"Glenn\\nDavis?  That\\'s insane\".  Yes.  So, without further ado:\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.\\nWEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be\\n  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.\\n  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize\\n  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can\\'t move Ripken out of the #3\\n  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.\\nObPrediction:  \"The Streak\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in\\n  caught stealing.\\n\\n2. New York Yankees.\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American\\n  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.\\nWEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner \\n  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far\\n  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to\\n  win a division.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.\\nObPrediction:  Mattingly won\\'t top a 700 OPS.\\n\\n3.  Toronto Blue Jays\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie\\n  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.\\n  Guzman.  Alomar.\\nWEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.\\n  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that\\'s *really* a bad sign).  No one in\\n  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.\\nObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And\\n  have a losing record.\\n\\n4.  Milwaukee Brewers\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.\\nWEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can\\'t keep it up.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.\\nWOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.\\nObPrediction:  Surhoff won\\'t finish the year at third.\\n\\n5.  Cleveland Indians\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy\\nWEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix\\n  Fermin.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki\\'s ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.\\nObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.\\n\\n6.  Boston Red Sox\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens\\nWEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre\\n  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL\\nObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.

Please\\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\\nAL only, please.\\n\\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\\nthat a team\\'s win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It\\'s not a definite,\\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\\nevaluate Viola\\'s as better than Morris\\' in the sense that \"had Morris\\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\\n\\n>It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out\\n>here in the real world guys.\\n\\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\\n\\nComputer...if you don\\'t open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight\\noff to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large ax.

Joe Morgan thinks that Bonds-Clark-\\nWilliams should be the 3-4-5 hitters.  While he believes that Clark-Bonds-\\nWilliams is fine, he definitely is of the opinion that Bonds should hit\\nahead of Williams.  I am inclined to agree with him.\\nYour first reason is not valid because Bonds can hit both lefties and righties\\nvery well.  He hits lefties or righties better than any other Giant\\nWilliams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season.\\nBut, the bottom line is Bonds is a far more disciplined and more productive\\nhitter than Williams, and I prefer to take my chances with Bonds driving in\\nthe 1, 2 or 3 hitters (who are expected to have high OBPs) than with Williams.\\nWilliams would get more fastballs with Bonds on first and second base open\\nbecause of the threat of Bonds stealing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I like these guys/gals!\\nI will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball.\\nIt was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to\\nthe Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the\\nAFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it,\\nbut I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with\\na lot of baseball fans in other cities.  \\n\\nBaseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion\\nteams bring back some excitement.  We'll find out Friday how Denver\\nBronco fans respond. \\n\\nPhillies are 2-0! (I better say it now before my opportunity passes\\nby)\\n\",\n",

It might be that pre-back\\nproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance\\ncaused, but now he\\'s lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts\\nhim. The old saying if you\\'re hot its a trigger mechanism, if you\\'re\\ncold, its a hitch. \\n\\n>First, minimize movement before the swing.

He changes his stance so much, he loses\\ntrack of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday\\'s night game, he was \\nclearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to\\nme. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because\\nhe\\'s changed his stance so much.\\n\\nI\\'m also a bit concerned that because he\\'s got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting\\nall the homeruns, he\\'ll become competitive, swing even harder and screw\\nhimself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco\\'s famous batting\\npractice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged\\nbad hitting habits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRuss Smith\\n*******************************************************************************\\n\"I don\\'t know anything about X\\'s, but I know about some O.\"              \\n                  George Gervin on being an assistant coach\\n********************************************************************************\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

My wife and I picked this game to go to\\nand thus caused the return of the pre-season-projected Sox\\noffense.  Like all no-no\\'s Bosio was good, lucky (hard grounder\\nby Vaughn off T. Martinez\\' glove but straight to Boone who \\nthrew to Bosio at first, 3-4-1), and backed by good defense\\n(many non-trivial groundouts).  The game was amazingly fast,\\nas the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also \\nworking fast.  The Sox relief pitching was ok -- the runs off\\nQuantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single\\nwhich Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch.\\n\\nGreenwell\\'s mental stability is a serious concern (I guess it\\nhas always been, but his quirks were amusing back when he was\\nan MVP candidate).  Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a\\nafter striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently Johnson\\nmade an \"ok, I\\'ve got to stay focused\" gesture which Iron Mike\\ninterpreted as taunting), and struck out to heavy booing the \\nnext two times.  As Valentine noted, last night he came up in\\nthe first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game.\\nCan you say \"take the first pitch\"?  Not Mike, who dribbled it\\ninto a 6-4-3.  The PI quoted Bosio that this was a \"batting\\npractice fastball\".  Next time up he also hit the first pitch,\\na hard liner straight to KGJr in center.  He also made the\\npathetic error and failed to catch Boone\\'s HR (which looked \\ncomparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlight\\nreel that night).\\n\\nIs Riles suppsoed to be good defensively?  I couldn\\'t tell from\\nthe field angle but his range looked bad, and he coughed a DP\\nthat cost a run or two.  Why was he leadoff?  I hope Fletcher\\ngets well soon.\\n\\nAlso on lineups, Pinella put Bret Boone fifth for reasons beyond\\nme.  It seemed to work, as he was 3-4 with a HR and some good\\ndefense (a wag behind us said \"He sure don\\'t want to go back to\\nCalgary!\")  There is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth\\nbecause they\\'ll likely lead off the second (as Boone did).\\n\\nWell, now we face the hot Angels and another power pitcher in\\nLangston.

Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what\\nthe outcome will be over the course of 162 games.\\n\\n===============================================================================\\n| joec@godot.cyprs.rain.com     |WARNING: Elvis impersonating can be hazardous|\\n| joec@ursula.ee.pdx.edu        |         to your health -- it sure won't help|\\n|                               |         your reputation.                    |\\n+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+\\n| I bike, therefore I am!       | Go Red Sox!

       "  u'From: dxf12@po.CWRU.Edu (Douglas Fowler)\\nSubject: (ATAS) N.L. games 8/2-8/5 & standings of all\\nArticle-I.D.: usenet.1pqf84$caf\\nOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio (USA)\\nLines: 237\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: slc12.ins.cwru.edu\\n\\n\\n     Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday\\n     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four\\ngame series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\\n\"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\\nare challenging?\\n     \"It\\'s pitching, it\\'s always been pitching that we\\'ve lacked,\" announced\\nRyne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we\\'ll know we might be able to\\nwin.\\n     \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"\\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell\\'s speed allowed him to cut the ball off\\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \\n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don\\'t have to pitch to Schmidt or\\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\\nRose at first), and it\\'s a credit to the Phillies that they\\'ve been able to\\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas\\' grounder\\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\\n     Sunday\\'s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren\\'t among the\\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\\nfirst in this wacky season.\\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\\nThe Cards captured Monday\\'s game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\\nRogers 3-2.  \"We\\'re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don\\'t see why we can\\'t win this\\ndivision.\"\\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\\n    \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\\npitcher\\'s park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\\nHernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only\\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets\\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \\n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\\npitching that just wouldn\\'t tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves\\' park had been a homer\\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday\\'s\\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the \\'61 Yankees\\' pace.\\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves\\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff\\'s batting average was even rising.  Of\\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can\\'t afford\\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\\'t\\nafford to let the Astros beat us.\"  He then winked and said: \"Well, maybe\\nDavis will get decked once.\"\\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\\nthe nastness of the Astros\\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It\\'s as if some three-year-old threw a\\ntantrum and told his playmates: \\'If I can\\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit\\nhome runs\\',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\\nAstros didn\\'t score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\\n     \"They\\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\\'ve got to be ready to\\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We\\'ll go with\\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers\\'\\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\\n     \"We\\'re mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\\nplays can do it now and then.  We\\'re sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\\nguess that\\'s why they\\'re so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The \\'Stros\\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\\n     Standings after these weekend series:\\nA.L.East\\nTeam                     W           L           GB\\nNew York                68        42          --\\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\\nDetroit                 64        46           4\\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\\nWashington              39         73          28\\n\\nA.L.West\\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\\nMinnesota               61         48            1\\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\\nCalifornia              57         56            8\\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\\n\\nN.L.East\\nChicago          57         53                --\\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\\nNew York         48         64               10\\n\\nN.L.West\\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\\nHouston          50          61               17.5\\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5\\n-- \\nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, \\'cause Heaven is just a great\\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\\n',\n",

Also the Mets (my other least \\nfavorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a \\ngreat start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.\\n\\nBig Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be\\nhitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots\\nof hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on\\nsituational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower\\nthis year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and\\nLankford and Zeile\\'s off year).\\n\\nI don\\'t know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the \\nFilly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  \\nGive the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games \\nand we\\'ll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching \\nstaff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the\\ndifference.\\n\\nOn a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some \\nbaseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked \\nwhere to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied \"Fair.\"  I \\nremember it being in the \"They Said It\" section of Sports Illustrated.\\nI would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.\\n\\nGO REDBIRDS!!\\n\\nGary Wieman\\n',\n",

The only reason\\n>he did then because he was *very* bothered by the call.  I expect his\\n>concentration wasn\\'t there yet, and in a crucial situation I imagine it\\'s\\n>best to be as calm as possible.  Contributing factors would be Gant\\'s\\n>bad day at the plate, bad year at the plate, and the Braves long scoring\\n>drought.\\n\\nAnd it is not Hirschbeck\\'s job to help Gant with any of these difficulties.\\nIf Gant can\\'t gather his concentration for whatever reason, that just makes\\nhim all the more meat in the batter\\'s box.  The umpire\\'s job is to \\nmaintain flow of play.  Gant is not entitled to time to regather his\\nfaculties.\\n\\nNor is anyone else.\\n\\n>Now, it\\'s pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is\\n>telling you to get in there.  You know the umpire is going to do something\\n>(call for a strike, throw you out, etc.).  Gant was wrong.\\n\\nAbsolutely.  I think it\\'d be more accurate to say Gant was foolish.\\n\\n>But Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view.  Aside from the major chip\\n>he seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem.  Gant had a reason\\n>to want some time (disputed strike call).  \\n\\nIf a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout, games would last\\nabout nine-fifteen weeks, if Jack Morris or Dave \"Whiner\" Stieb were\\npitching.  A disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out.\\nSuck it up, get back in the box, and never badmouth the blue.  They\\'re\\nnot going to change their mind, and you\\'re just going to come across\\nas a pinhead, which won\\'t help you with the borderline calls.\\n\\nFTR - I never speak to umpires when I don\\'t know them personally, nor\\ndo I glance at them, or react to calls.  As a result, I think I get more\\nthan my fair share of borderline calls at the plate, because I have a\\nrep of having a good eye.  (Actually, there are a lot of negative\\nconnotations that go with that rep, including copious questions about\\nmy masculinity, party affiliation, and sexual preference.)\\n\\n>Gant hadn\\'t been wasting time all\\n>game.  The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old.\\n\\nIrrelevant.  He was wasting time THEN.\\n\\n>The score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.\\n>Is there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn\\'t, and shouldn\\'t, cut Gant a little\\n>slack?  \\n\\n1.  Because it\\'s not his job.\\n\\n2.  Because setting the precedent of cutting slack THERE can easily \\n    extend to those 3 hour games.  (Kind of like the phantom DP.)\\n\\n>For no discernible constructive reason, Hirschbeck disrupted the\\n>game, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key\\n>situation.  Did he have a date to get to?\\n\\nGant hurt himself, and the Braves disrupted the game.  Your biases are\\nexposed, and I\\'m sitting here defending umpires and the SF Giants,\\nwhich is like Phyllis Schlafly defending Gary Segura, Jack Kevorkian,\\nand the Swedish Abortion Team.  \\n\\n>And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game.\\n\\nI believe Terry said the magic word.  There are some truly quick ways\\nto get tossed from a ballgame.  For a primer, email me.\\n\\nGood ways to get tossed from a game:\\n\\n1.  Ask Ken Kaiser if he got his money back from Nutri-System.\\n2.  Kiss Rich Garcia on the lips, and say \"Hi, Honey, I\\'m Home!\"\\n3.  Goose Eric Gregg.\\n4.  Ask Bruce Froemming if his parents had any children that lived.\\n5.

His\\n1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to\\nthird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,\\nhe began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.\\n\\nBut no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye\\nover the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,\\nhe was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came\\nup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through\\n2 position changes in the space of a year.  He\\'s an adequate OF,\\nalthough not great, and at least some of your perception of his\\nfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the\\nML level.  (I know you\\'re another long-term Braves fan :)\\n\\nAbout playing 3B...IMO, that\\'s the 2nd most DIFFICULT position\\nto field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and \\nspeed, but at 3B, you\\'ve got to have quick reflexes and have \\na GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when\\nplaying sandlot softball!  Granted, I\\'d still put my best\\noverall infielder at SS, but that\\'s because he gets more\\nchances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me\\nthat so many teams have tried to convert other position players\\nto 3B.  But maybe that\\'s because the supply of \"natural\" 3B is\\nscarce.\\n\\nFinally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to\\nperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don\\'t get\\nthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a\\nlot of weight work.  Now, whether he\\'s been overdoing it these\\ndays may be a valid question, as is the question of whether\\nhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.\\nBut frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,\\nI\\'d much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not\\ntrying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation\\nto an adult; but at that age I don\\'t believe you can teach\\nhustle.\\n\\nAll that said, I don\\'t think I\\'d sign Gant to another long-term\\ncontract.  He\\'s 28 now, and I think he\\'s free-agent eligible\\nin 2 years, when he\\'ll be 30.  Given his career curve and\\nlimitations, I wouldn\\'t expect him to last much past 35\\nas a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta\\'s\\ngot some talent on the farm, and I\\'d rather take my chances\\ndown the road with Nieves et al.\\n\\nEric\\n',\n",

And enlightening.\\n\\nHere\\'s my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep \\'92, and Jose Canseco,\\ncirca June 1986.\\n\\n1.  He\\'s bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\\n    not gain more bulk.\\n\\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I\\'d say he\\'s\\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that\\'s a HUGE amount of speed.\\n\\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\\n    Canseco can\\'t.  Also, note that Canseco doesn\\'t always close his\\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\\n    they\\'re fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it\\'s hard\\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\\n\\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\\n\\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\\nso that I\\'d never have to work again, I\\'d restructure my entire swing.\\n\\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\\nthe bathead more freely.\\n\\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\\n\\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\\nthe park.\\n\\nIf Canseco\\'s open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\\nproblems, he\\'ll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\\nstill hit 600+ HR.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n*   Gary Huckabay   * \"You think that\\'s loud enough, a$$hole?\"           *\\n*   \"Movie Rights   * \"Well, if you\\'re having trouble hearing it, sir,   *\\n*   available thru  *  I\\'d be happy to turn it up for you.

Don Baylor was his batting coach at St. Louis last\\nyear, and now, as his manager, is continuing to work with him.  Maybe Andres\\nhas a \"weak\" left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the\\nball.  Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - I dunno.

It appears that in\\na neutral park Bo\\'s HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\\n\\nOne thing, when looking at Bo\\'s stats, is that you can see that KC took\\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \\nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \\n\\n> That is good.

I thought he\\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \\nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t\\nwinning.\\n\\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\\nmistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group)\\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\\n\\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\\n\\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\\na player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe\\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean?\\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \\n\\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE\\'s.  But you guys DON\\'T KNOW.  What\\'s \\nworse, you don\\'t know that you don\\'t.  And you don\\'t know that there are \\nother players you won\\'t know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \\nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.

I\\'d call that \"predicting the\\n>future\".\\n\\nThat is *your* opinion that Sabo is \"clearly a better hitter\" than\\nSamuel.  The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season.\\nLast season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted).\\nThis season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with more\\nat bats.  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better\\nhitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has been\\na better hitter in certain situations than Sabo.\\n\\nI did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get a\\nhit.  I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager (or\\neven a Reds fan) that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that\\nsituation than Sabo.\\n\\n\\n>>If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time, I assume you\\n>>would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch-\\n>>hitting Samuel.

No better than a coin toss.\\nI actually *do* accept your work.\\n\\nAs it happens, I also have an *opinion* that in certain situations,\\nfor certain players, a history of superior or inferior ability to\\nhit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be\\nvalid in projecting future player performance.  For that player.\\nAnd Chris Sabo is one such player.\\n\\n\\n>So tell me?  Does the term fit?

Olson was still\\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\\n\\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\\nand Berryhill couldn\\'t hit their way out of a wet cardboard\\nbox, and don\\'t walk enough to be useful.\\n\\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\\nat the start of the season, he wouldn\\'t have gotten his job back.\\n\\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\\nPlus, you\\'d have to eat that salary, which isn\\'t huge, but isn\\'t\\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson\\'s at about $800,000, Berryhill\\nat $450,000, but that\\'s only what I recall).\\n\\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\\naren\\'t eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\\n\\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn\\'t on the team.\\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\\nand the truth is that I\\'d rather see our best team on the field,\\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\\n\\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won\\'t need him. ;)\\n\\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\\nlike this:  (Remember, they\\'ve BOTH been GM\\'s)\\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\\n\\nCox:  OK, we\\'ve sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\\nis better than it used to be.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\\njust won\\'t sign that baseball only contract.  We can\\'t count\\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman\\'s not ready to give up on\\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher\\'s gone AND Deion signs,\\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\\n\\nCox:  Yep, that\\'ll be nice.  Too bad Deion won\\'t sign.\\nOK, I\\'ll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\\nKlesko?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ve still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\\nbut somehow he doesn\\'t seem to be the same GM.  First\\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I\\'d HAVE to believe that he\\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\\n\\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I\\'ll wait til the trading\\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\\nAnd if that doesn\\'t work, then perhaps Sid\\'s knees\\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There\\'s always the\\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\\n\\nCox:  Well, he\\'s not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\\nin Richmond, he\\'ll start walking more.  Besides, if he\\'s going to be\\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Now, let\\'s see.  That leaves Lopez.\\n\\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn\\'t think Olson\\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\\nrunning into him again?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he\\'ll get\\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson\\'s shown his stuff a little\\nbit, I can\\'t trade him.  Besides, Berryhill\\'s a left-handed\\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\\n\\nCox:  Don\\'t you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you\\'re the one who wouldn\\'t write Lopez\\ninto the lineup.\\n\\nCox:  Well, you\\'re the one who went out and got me Jeff\\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn\\'t be used\\nto our pitching staff\\'s stuff.  He got some time with\\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.

My\\n*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently\\n(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might\\nbe able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players\\n(as opposed to all baseball players).\\n\\n  As a counterexample to \\n>what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\\n>\\n>               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\\n>               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\\n> \\n>Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\\n>Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\\n>\\n>If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\\n>situations, you\\'d bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \\n>1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\\n>hit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \\n>completely cooking the data,\\n\\nYou won\\'t hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interesting\\nthat you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also \\nlooked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA),\\nhitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has\\nbeen traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting \\nrecord is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would\\nnot draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based\\non his prior performance.  I don\\'t know how I would have felt in 1988,\\nbut you may indeed be right.  \\n\\nWhen I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and\\na more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately\\nbelow his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter.\\n\\nThis probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\\nwith others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical\\nhistory be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before\\nit has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\\nstatistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\\n\\n\\n>BTW, correlating players\\' _overall_ batting average from \\'84-\\'87 with\\n>\\'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\\n>something better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\\n>(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \\n>0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\\n\\nI completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find\\nthe same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent\\nbasis? \\n\\n>Actually, it\\'s technically incorrect to say that we can\\'t predict future\\n>clutch performance.  It\\'s more correct to say that we can\\'t predict\\n>future clutch performance with any skill.\\n>\\namen.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\n-- \\nMark Singer    \\nmss@netcom.com\\n',\n",

He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In\\ncase anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe\\nRuth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan\\nGonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that \\nhe had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record\\nbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I \\nam wrong.  \\n\\tOnto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I\\ncan't get McPaper consistently around here.  \\ncomment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals\\nthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could \\nhit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish\\nwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  \\nleadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm \\nlucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals\\nalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I\\nhaven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going\\nto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this\\nyear is stealing bases.\\nSheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.\\nWitness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,\\nor anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.\\nAndy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is \\nthis a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone \\nseen him pitch the two good games?\\nscore for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6.  Padres sweep the\\nCardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.

Sci., Urbana, IL\\nLines: 117\\n\\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\\nStillwell would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kurt\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt\\'s 57.6% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Double\\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n1.015 Sandberg\\n .865 Alicea\\n .852 Thompson\\n .755 DeShields\\n .705 Doran\\n .678 *NL Average*\\n .656 Biggio\\n .602 Harris\\n .582 Randolph\\n .580 Morandini\\n .573 Lemke\\n .571 Lind\\n .336 Stillwell\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.838 Baerga\\n.812 Alomar\\n.811 Fletcher\\n.806 Whitaker\\n.757 Blankenship\\n.725 Miller\\n.718 Knoblauch\\n.708 Reed\\n.704 Bordick\\n.691 *AL Average*\\n.636 Kelly\\n.631 Ripken\\n.603 Reynolds\\n.602 Sojo\\n.555 Sax\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.

A \\nplayer\\'s batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.\\nA player\\'s ability to walk or infielder\\'s Defensive Average are correlated\\nbetter.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics\\nwe can have a pretty good handle on how they\\'ll do next year.  Put in \\nsome simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of \\nthe basic problems with something like \"clutch\" batting average - overall\\nbatting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. \\nAdding to the sample size doesn\\'t seem to help much.  As a counterexample to \\nwhat you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\\n\\n               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\\n               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\\n \\nMaldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\\nLemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\\n\\nIf you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\\nsituations, you\\'d bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \\n1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\\nhit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \\ncompletely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ \"clutch\"\\nat bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple\\nmeasure of clutchness, let\\'s just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use \\n\\'84-\\'87 to predict \\'88 for those 96 players, you\\'d find that 27 of the\\n96 were below league average in that measure both in \\'84-87 and in \\'88,\\n26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were \\nabove in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,\\nyou\\'d expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The\\ndifference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment\\nis not statisically significant.\\n\\nBTW, correlating players\\' _overall_ batting average from \\'84-\\'87 with\\n\\'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\\nsomething better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\\n(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \\n0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\\n\\n>\\n>\\n>>       Everyone would agree (I hope) that a grand \\n>>\\tslam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three\\n>>\\tis a VERY clutch hit.

I\\nwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.\\n\\n2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an\\nimpressive win last week. NOw Otto\\'s latest debacle has restored Simmon\\'s\\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his \\'92 form when he had the\\nAL\\'s highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted\\'s sake), I hope he\\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\\n\\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\\nthe plate in his rookie year.\\n\\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\\nWalk desrved his contract.\\n\\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\\ncan\\'t understand his and management\\'s fear of losing Tom Prince through\\nwaivers. Even if they do, what\\'s the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\\npitching). Didn\\'t Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\\nwasn\\'t very fit last year.\\n\\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\\non Patterson in stead.\\n\\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn\\'t been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\\n\\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn\\'t given a contract extension last year? NOw his\\nvalue has increased immensely.\\n\\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\\nLet\\'s see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won\\'t be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\\n\\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting).

The Mariners\\nhad the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the\\nfielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.  \\n\\nNow, without a judgement call (and I don\\'t think there is one), this is an RBI\\nfor the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be \"defensive\\nindifference\", since it doesn\\'t really matter whether the guy at third scores\\nat that point.  (I know, I can think of several \"If the Mariners stole third\\nand second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a\\ngrounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and\\nthird, he wouldn\\'t have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and\\nmaybe he therefore can\\'t make the throw to first to get the last out, etc...\\nscenarios, too.  But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when\\nyou\\'re down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)\\n\\nThe point is that the batter (IMO) shouldn\\'t get \"credit\" (an RBI) for utterly\\nfailing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not\\ntrade an out for one run.

Sci., Urbana, IL\\nLines: 118\\n\\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Juan\\nGonzalez would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Juan\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin\\'s 55.4% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Extra \\nBases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.

The Twins took two of three games in the series,\\nwith scores as follows:\\n\\n                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10\\n                                        Mil  0\\n                   Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0)  \\n\\n                  Wednesday April 21st  Mil 10  (10)\\n                                        MN   8\\n                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )\\n\\n                  Thursday April 22nd   MN  5\\n                                        Mil 4\\n                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)\\n                    Sa - Aguilera\\n\\nHighlight/Low Lights of the Series:\\n------------------------------------\\nJim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of\\nthe American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0\\nwith a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning\\nhis ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with\\nPhiladelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail\\nlook like a true genius.\\n\\nWillie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings\\non Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now \\ncombine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are\\n0-5.\\n\\nWednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the\\nTwins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and \\nsubsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead\\nto 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing\\n4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.\\nTapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike\\nHartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and\\nthe Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win\\nit.\\n\\nAguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown\\nsaves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.\\nComing into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,\\nthen hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the\\nside.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.\\nWeak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.\\n\\nGeneral News\\n-------------------------------------\\nPedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on\\nTuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,\\nthough, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former\\nGopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.\\n\\nThe Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting\\nPitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit\\nTigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide \\nquite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.\\n\\nThe Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,\\nthe third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.\\n\\nBrian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second\\nthis year, and shows much improvement in this category.\\n\\nJim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he \\nhas the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch\\nout of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 \\nstart.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly\\nin response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the\\nrubber on the pick-off move.\\n\\n\\nCurrent MLB AL West Standings( from Joesph Hernandez, jtchern@ocb.berkeley.edu  )\\n\\nAMERICAN WEST         Won  Lost   Pct.

Guy didn\\'t hit a lick, had\\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don\\'t \\nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn\\'t field,\\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\\nOBP wasn\\'t THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \\n\\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80\\'s.  I know that\\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn\\'t overrated by the media.  \\n\\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one\\'s actually pretty close.  He\\'s had a s\\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \\n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I\\'d have to take a closer look at the stats (it\\'s been \\na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \\n\\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn\\'t mean a whole hell of a lot if you \\nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \\nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \\nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\\n\\tDarrell Evans?

Big deal.\\n>Let\\'s be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so\\n>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something\\n\\n\\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he\\'s won something along\\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \\ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie\\'s more\\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\\n80\\'s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie\\'s\\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against Tom Niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  His \\'82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\\nSS numbers go.

When \\n>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential \\n>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to\\n>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?\\n\\n\\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you\\'re right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn\\'t be in the HOF.\\n\\tSkyJack?  I\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout Morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  Morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he\\'s \\njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\\n(Of course, Nolan\\'s a HOF\\'er...)\\n\\tPuck?  Probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the HOF, most\\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \\ntragic or sudden).  He\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  I\\'ve always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.

Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above\\nor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from \\nthe mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.\\nIn the four years (\\'84-\\'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there\\nwere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch \\nsituations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of\\nthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two\\nyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and\\nreally horrible the other year.

The\\n\\treporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he\\n\\tgave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with\\n\\tthe fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that\\n\\tspeak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not\\n\\tthe) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac\\n\\tMcCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his\\n\\tbook, _All The Pretty Horses_.

Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark: Cal\\nRipken for his 1984 season. Rounding out the top five offensive players\\nin the NL last season: Sheffield, 5.9; Sandberg, 5.8; Van Slyke, 5.3; and\\nLarkin, 4.7.\\n\\nThe top 5 offensive players in the AL in 1992 were: E. Martinez, 4.8;\\nVentura, 4.8; Anderson, 4.5; R. Henderson, 4.4; and Thomas, 4.4\\n\\nIn short, Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons\\never in the game's history -- better than any year had by Mantle,\\nMays, Williams, etc. (If you disagree, don't flame me; flame the\\nwriters of Total Baseball.) Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and\\nneck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one\\nhad the better year can be considered a toss-up. Thus, Total Baseball\\nsupports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of 1992.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\n--------------------------\\nPhil Brown                |\\naka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |\\n--------------------------\\n\",\n",

I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n>Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first;\\n>about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with\\n>the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score\\n>tied, for another .22.  And, finally, in the ninth to win the game by a score\\n>of 7-6, for a value of 0.5.  Bob hit 4 solo HR in 4 plate appearances, and\\n>was credited by your method with .12 + .14 + .22 + .5 = .98.  But what does\\n>that mean?  Was Bob 98% responsible for the win?  Certainly not; the defense\\n>is *always* 50% responsible (if you include pitching in that), and Bob wasn\\'t\\n>pitching.  In fact, Bob was only 4/7 of the offense (which is a lot, but not\\n>even close to 100%).  Furthermore, what about the other 3 team runs?  Say\\n>they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game,\\n>which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will\\n>himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have\\n>amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There\\'s clearly a problem here.\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n>>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the\\n>>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs\\n>>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming.\\n>>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough.\\n>\\n>In another article, I proposed a test of this.  We can predict a team\\'s \\n>won/lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs *total* they\\n>score and allow, without regard to when those runs score in the game.  If\\n>late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at\\n>late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n>Here\\'s another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What\\n>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost\\n>exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.\\n>Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with\\n>no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who \\n>scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.\\n>\\n>Does this make sense?\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?  They were probably about the same.\\n\\n                                                        Brian Smith\\n',\n",

I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not.

I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers.

I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame.

And that\\n>is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\\n\\nThere\\'s an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball\\nteam and some people\\'s conception of a biological organism.  In the\\nbiology context, we would very likely read \"fitness\" for \"the score of\\nthe game\" and \"organisms\" for \"teams\".  How we interpret \"players\" is\\ntrickier, but either \"organs\", or \"genes\" might seem reasonable\\nchoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A \"genes\"\\ninterpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, \\nbut that would be a different and probably longer post.\\n\\nIf, however, we take the \"organ\" view, then our knowledge of biology\\nshould make us pause before we start saying things like \"species X is\\nmore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z\".  Given what we\\nknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious\\nof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often\\nmade when you map \"species X\" onto \\'humans\\', and \"organ Z\" onto\\n\\'brain\\').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. \\'brain\\'\\nabove might be more reasonable than \\'pancreas\\' assuming no gross\\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\\n\\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\\n\\n>To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\n>solutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B\\n>in their lineup.

But, of\\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\\n\\n>If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens\\n>has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a\\n>criteria, then fine.\\n\\nIn this cases, we\\'re seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\\n\\n>But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the\\n>individual\\'s contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only\\n>measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.\\n\\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\\nit\\'s unclear what it all really means.\\n\\n***\\n\\nNow just one more un-related point:\\n\\n>I have yet to see that any of you can predict a\\n>WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\\n\\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren\\'t the only difference\\nbetween the winners and the losers.\\n\\nMoreover, you\\'ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\\n\\n>The stats are a nice hobby and that\\'s about it.  There is no new\\n>knowledge being produced.  \\n\\nSince stats are summaries of events, it\\'s true that if you know the\\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\\nuseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge\\nin a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge\\neven though I\\'m relying on stats to do it.\\n\\njking\\n\\n',\n",

There are two big problems:\\n\\n\\t1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike\\n\\t  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an\\n\\t  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem\\n \\t  to have no clue about any team that doesn\\'t play on\\n\\t  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20\\n\\t  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the\\n\\t  country. It\\'s very rare to hear an out-of-town score\\n\\t  being reported on WIP.\\n\\n\\t2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss\\n\\t  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have\\n\\t  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.\\n\\t  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely\\n\\t  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.\\n\\nAnyway, that\\'s my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.\\n\\n-Alan\\n',\n",

Being me, of course, I\\nused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,\\nand I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent\\naverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I\\ncompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and\\nhere\\'s why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the\\nsystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above\\nreplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;\\n1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks\\nsubstantially right.\\n\\nIn the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I\\nhad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of\\n.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is\\n\"Billy Ripken\". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the\\nsame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I\\nhave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs\\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded\\noff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:\\nRandy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo\\nGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)\\nin left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.\\n\\nSo, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and\\nfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of\\nbatting outs, like 400.

I suspect that a comment like \"I enjoy hitting fourth; I\\'m\\nused to it\" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if\\nit came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying,\\n\"I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best\\nin that role.\"  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems like\\na fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question \\nlike, \"How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?\"\\nA more media-sensitive player might answer \"The manager knows what he is\\ndoing.

If I were Darryl, I\\'d probably answer that\\nquestion, \"The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get\\npaid for RBIs.  I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willing\\nto hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team.\"  or something like\\nthat.  It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was\\nhitting third--and make him sound like a \"team\" player.  Since Strawberry\\nwill not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for\\nhis next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help   \\nhis image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.\\n\\nRemember, the media is of the belief that one\\'s best RBI man should hit\\nfourth, so the argument is sensible, regardless of whether or not it is\\ntrue.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Jeff\\n',\n",

While\\nI\\'m all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples\\nof rampant Hargroving, there was a difference here.\\n\\n1)  Since time immemorial, batters have complained about calls.\\nSo have pitchers and catchers.  Usually, nothing happens.\\nUnless the league notified teams this year about not allowing\\ncomplaints, Hirschbeck was acting against expectations.\\n\\n2)  It\\'s not as if Gant was \"in Hirschbeck\\'s face\".  Gant said\\nsomething about the call, stepped out of the box, and turned away\\nfrom Hirschbeck.  As a hitter (alibet of little consequence, but\\nwith a decent eye), whenever receiving the short end of the stick\\non a questionable call, I\\'d want a moment or two out of the box,\\nif for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on\\nthe experience of the last pitch.  And if I was really angry\\nat the ump, I\\'d rather turn away and catch my breath than\\nturn to him and say something that might get me tossed,\\nespecially at a key moment in the game.\\n\\nWhen Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant\\nto step into the box.  IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeck\\nwas determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game.\\nGant wasn\\'t dawdling; he hadn\\'t had a chance to dawdle.  And Hirschbeck\\nwas simply exercising a power play.  Gant resisted, as many of\\nus might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, and\\nHirschbeck called for the pitch.  At that point, Cox came out on\\nthe field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left the\\ndugout.  Cox was tossed \"protecting his player\".  I was pleasantly\\nsurprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.\\n\\nIt\\'s a small sample size, but based on what I saw in that game,\\nMark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play\\nGod on the field.  Not good qualities for an umpire.

As far as I\\ncan tell he doesn\\'t have any particular problem in his mechanics\\n(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\\nthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\\nclear that up is playing and practice time.

Olsen  and\\nBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\\nthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost\\nall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn\\nthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to\\nlearn Tom Glavine\\'s pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn\\'t\\nbe supprised if the pitcher\\'s claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over\\npitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But \\ngiven time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.\\n\\n\\tNow, since Lopez can\\'t learn how to handle the major league\\npitcher\\'s while he\\'s in AAA and since he doesn\\'t have any glaring\\nproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he\\ncan\\'t learn just as well while in the majors?  \\n\\nDave\\n__________\\nDave Bonar\\nmebonar@lsuvax.sncc.lsu.edu\\n__________\\n\\n',\n",

That did not address\\nthe problem of the continuity of the game.

I doubt if anyone watching\\nthe Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out.  I doubt if anyone\\nwatching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an\\nopportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that\\nwas present.  I would be totally opposed to any effort that would\\neliminate that aspect of baseball.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful\\nenough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they\\nare actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games \\nout the way that they do.

       "  u'From: sam@steamer.clam.com (Sam Mandelbaum)\\nSubject: Yankee Thoughts\\nOrganization: CLaM Associates, Cambridge, MA 02141\\nLines: 76\\n\\n\\nYes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are \\nfinally moving in the right direction.  They should finish\\nover .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race \\nin August.  However, I would take back a few moves:\\n\\n1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.\\n    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a\\n    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year, \\n    but he won\\'t because the right side of the Yanks infield\\n    isn\\'t good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?  \\n    JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and\\n    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on \\n    the Angels?  I know it\\'s early, but if you\\'ve seen this kid\\n    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be \\n    a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What\\n    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it\\'s great that the Yanks\\n    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he\\'s 10 years\\n    older than Snow and just doesn\\'t have the same bat speed as\\n    before his back injury.  It\\'s a shame, but as a Yankee fan \\n    who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I\\'d take \\n    Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two\\n    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with\\n    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling\\n    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts\\n    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George\\n    forced this trade because he believes (and he\\'s right) that\\n    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I\\'d like to see the\\n    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.\\n\\n2.  Wade Boggs.\\n    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is \\n    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop\\n    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).\\n    Besides, Wade just doesn\\'t have any range.  What a shame about\\n    Charlie Hayes, huh?\\n\\n3.  Spike Owen.\\n    See Wade Boggs.  I\\'d much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri\\n    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is\\n    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys\\n    are on the down sides of their careers.\\n\\n4.  Danny Tartabull.\\n    Yes - he\\'s put up some tremendous numbers and it\\'s nice to think\\n    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he\\n    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,\\n    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O\\'Neil is playing\\n    left field!  I believe O\\'Neil led NL outfielders in assists\\n    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right\\ndirection but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should\\n(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This\\nmeans getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they \\nwill be ready in a year or two.  \\n\\nI\\'m afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.\\nCertainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is\\nplanning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world\\nseries now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any\\ntime (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,\\nthen add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep\\nthem).  Let\\'s all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn\\'t dismantle\\nthe terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee\\norganization back into one of respect.  I\\'m really afraid that he will\\ntrade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for\\nexample).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is\\nstill one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all\\nenjoy the future.  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it\\'s baseball\\nhell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!\\n\\nSam \"I\\'m not Militello or Millitello\" Mandelbaum.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Suppose we have a large population\\nof people who play this game every week.\\n\\nIn the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population\\nwill win 7 or more times.\\n\\nIn the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again\\nbe 7-time winners.\\n\\nIn the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in\\neach of the first two years will win 7 again.\\n\\nSuppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three\\nyears, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last\\nthree years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.\\n\\nDo we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?\\nNo.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these\\n\"consistent winners\" can influence their chances of winning.  But\\nsuppose we *don\\'t* know whether or not there is a chance that skill\\nmight be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are\\npsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?\\n\\nWe can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the\\npopulation will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a\\nhigh positive correlation (even if they aren\\'t very good psychics,\\nthey should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net\\nresult?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.\\n\\n>This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\\n>with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical\\n>history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before\\n>it has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\\n>statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\\n\\nWell, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has\\nhit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at\\nthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse\\nas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn\\'t\\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\\n\\nNow if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true\\nto form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn\\'t\\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks\\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You\\nlook at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more\\nlikely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at\\nthose numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to\\nbe clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\\nway.\\n\\n>I completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find\\n>the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent\\n>basis? \\n\\nThen we would have something useful.  And we would also have a\\npositive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a\\npattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern\\nand then reverses.\\n\\nCheers,\\n-Valentine\\n',\n",

At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\\n\\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\nsolutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B\\nin their lineup.

But you\\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\\nindividual\\'s  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\\nonly measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\\njective  and  is  mere opinion.

I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\\nindividual\\'s  performance   from that of his team\\'s for the purpose of\\ncomparing that individual\\'s performance with another individual\\'s per-\\nformance.\\n\\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that\\'s  about  it.

I would rather have the untried\\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\\nhimself to be average at best. I don\\'t care if he is 15; if he plays\\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I\\'ll admit). Santiago\\'s\\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy\\'s, but I don\\'t have\\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\\n\\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\\n.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on\\nthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was\\njust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87.

Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he\\'d\\nbe a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year.

I can buy the \"in the field\" part, and I think he\\'ll be\\nbetter at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he\\'ll\\nbe a pretty good hitter, couldn\\'t carry Boggs\\' jockstrap.

Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and \\noften by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some\\nrecently rare power with their bats.\\n\\nBelcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the\\ngame progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those\\nwere few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while\\nstriking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working\\nfor him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on \\nbreaking balls.\\n\\nTomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch\\ndouble to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and \\nBarry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys\\n(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact\\nthey all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal\\nand a Tomlin wild pitch.\\n\\nIn fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky\\nstart-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only\\n2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was\\npoorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would \\nlater score on Reggie Sanders\\' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead \\nafter 4.\\n\\nThe fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second\\ndouble of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the \\nleft field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on\\nTom Prince\\'s two-base passed ball.  \\n\\nThe Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the\\nfifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second \\nbeing of the \"bunt\" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a \\nfoul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith \"K\\'d\" to end any Pittsburgh hope.\\n\\nPittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,\\nMoeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings\\nwork.\\n\\nBarry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played \\nbruised his right thumb.

The player must be \\nperiodically re-evaluated to determine if he\\'s still injured (thus you \\ncannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not \\nwish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day \\nthat reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I \\nbelieve, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.

Sci., Urbana, IL\\nLines: 105\\n\\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kevin\\nBass would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kevin\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin\\'s 49.4% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Extra \\nBases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.

Trionfo)\\nSubject: Re: WFAN\\nOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio (USA)\\nLines: 92\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: hela.ins.cwru.edu\\n\\n\\n    I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment\\nof WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to\\nboth stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike\\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \\nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \\nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \\n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\\nMorning show:\\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \\nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\\nit was a major story.\\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\\nstyles of host.\\n\\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \\nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \\nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \\'guys\\')\\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \\neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\\nyou can\\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\\n\\n2PM to 4PM:\\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \\nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\\nare often hilarious.  \\n\\n4 PM to 7 PM:\\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\\nMike Missanelli but I just can\\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.  \\nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\\nhomer now.  I don\\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \\nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\\n\\n7 PM to Midnight:\\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\\nJets, or St. John\\'s basketball.  If the game is on the\\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\\nDuring the summer, it\\nis all talk on WIP.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \\n\\n\\n\\n            Rich\\n-- \\n  \"You\\'ve read the hat, now see the movie.\"\\n                   -Imus in the morning \\n  \"A blurb?

Although the\\n*average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left\\nfielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly\\nlower; if you are a left fielder but can\\'t hit well enough to keep a job\\nanywhere, then you certainly can\\'t hit well enough to keep a job at DH.\\n\\n\\n--\\nDavid Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu\\n\"We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.\"\\n\"Please rotate your phone 90 degrees and try again.\"\\nDisclaimer: I speak for no one and no one speaks for me.\\n',\n",

       "  u\"From: mss@netcom.com (Mark Singer)\\nSubject: Darrrrrrrrryl\\nOrganization: Netcom Online Communications Services (408-241-9760 login: guest)\\nLines: 64\\n\\n\\n\\nThe media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to\\ndeath, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.\\n\\nGerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two\\non and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the\\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\\n\\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\\n\\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \\nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\\nthe catch.\\n\\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \\nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\\nimpossible.\\n\\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\\nnine games.\\n\\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\\n\\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\\nof the fan.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nMark Singer    \\nmss@netcom.com\\n\"],\n",

Sci., Urbana, IL\\nLines: 95\\n\\nHaving run completely out of time, I\\'ve got to get my prophesies and\\npredictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse\\nfinishes in last year\\'s prediction contest.\\n\\nAL East -- 1993\\n\\n1.  Baltimore Orioles\\nWhy the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to\\nthis:\\n  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.\\n  -- Can\\'t bring myself to pick the Yankees\\n  -- Milwaukee was a fluke\\n  -- Indians aren\\'t ready to contend\\n  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn\\'t get any better\\n  -- Detroit\\'s pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\"\\n\"But you don\\'t really think the Orioles will win, do you.\"  No.  As a matter\\nof fact, I can\\'t see any team in the American League winning either division\\non paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-\\nbody has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \"You don\\'t really think that Brady\\nAnderson is going to repeat, do you?\"  No.  I\\'m basing the Orioles prediction\\non the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \"Glenn\\nDavis?  That\\'s insane\".  Yes.  So, without further ado:\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.\\nWEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be\\n  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.\\n  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize\\n  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can\\'t move Ripken out of the #3\\n  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.\\nObPrediction:  \"The Streak\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in\\n  caught stealing.\\n\\n2. New York Yankees.\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American\\n  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.\\nWEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner \\n  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far\\n  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to\\n  win a division.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.\\nObPrediction:  Mattingly won\\'t top a 700 OPS.\\n\\n3.  Toronto Blue Jays\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie\\n  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.\\n  Guzman.  Alomar.\\nWEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.\\n  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that\\'s *really* a bad sign).  No one in\\n  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.\\nObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And\\n  have a losing record.\\n\\n4.  Milwaukee Brewers\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.\\nWEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can\\'t keep it up.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.\\nWOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.\\nObPrediction:  Surhoff won\\'t finish the year at third.\\n\\n5.  Cleveland Indians\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy\\nWEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix\\n  Fermin.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki\\'s ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.\\nObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.\\n\\n6.  Boston Red Sox\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens\\nWEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre\\n  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL\\nObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.

Here\\'s a very simele question to which\\nI\\'m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\\nAL only, please.\\n\\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\\nthat a team\\'s win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It\\'s not a definite,\\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\\nevaluate Viola\\'s as better than Morris\\' in the sense that \"had Morris\\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\\n\\n>It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out\\n>here in the real world guys.\\n\\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\\n\\nComputer...if you don\\'t open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight\\noff to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large ax.

Joe Morgan thinks that Bonds-Clark-\\nWilliams should be the 3-4-5 hitters.  While he believes that Clark-Bonds-\\nWilliams is fine, he definitely is of the opinion that Bonds should hit\\nahead of Williams.

Hopefully the\\nCubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May\\nisn\\'t Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays\\nfull time.\\n\\nRight:\\n\\nFelix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does\\nSosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs\\n\\nStarters:\\n\\nAquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won\\'t\\nremind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard\\nis average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs\\n\\nMiddle Relief:\\n\\nEven. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins.\\nCarpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.\\n\\nCloser:\\n\\nA healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but\\nno Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save.\\nLook for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with\\na better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.\\n\\nOverall, an edge to Chicago.\\nNeither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course.\\ne\\n--\\nmsilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu\\t\\t\\t\\tGO CUBS!!!\\n\\n\"One likes to believe in the freedom of baseball\" - Geddy Lee\\n',\n",

Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a\\nafter striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently Johnson\\nmade an \"ok, I\\'ve got to stay focused\" gesture which Iron Mike\\ninterpreted as taunting), and struck out to heavy booing the \\nnext two times.  As Valentine noted, last night he came up in\\nthe first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game.\\nCan you say \"take the first pitch\"?  Not Mike, who dribbled it\\ninto a 6-4-3.  The PI quoted Bosio that this was a \"batting\\npractice fastball\".  Next time up he also hit the first pitch,\\na hard liner straight to KGJr in center.

Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of \\ndetracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what \\nhappens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly \\nnot that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all,\\nremember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that\\nfar, let alone beat Baltimore.\\n\\nLet's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football\\nand Basketball.

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\\n\"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\\nare challenging?\\n     \"It\\'s pitching, it\\'s always been pitching that we\\'ve lacked,\" announced\\nRyne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we\\'ll know we might be able to\\nwin.\\n     \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"\\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell\\'s speed allowed him to cut the ball off\\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \\n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don\\'t have to pitch to Schmidt or\\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\\nRose at first), and it\\'s a credit to the Phillies that they\\'ve been able to\\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas\\' grounder\\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\\n     Sunday\\'s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren\\'t among the\\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\\nfirst in this wacky season.\\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\\nThe Cards captured Monday\\'s game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\\nRogers 3-2.  \"We\\'re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don\\'t see why we can\\'t win this\\ndivision.\"\\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\\n    \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\\npitcher\\'s park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\\nHernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only\\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets\\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \\n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\\npitching that just wouldn\\'t tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves\\' park had been a homer\\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday\\'s\\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the \\'61 Yankees\\' pace.\\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves\\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff\\'s batting average was even rising.  Of\\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can\\'t afford\\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\\'t\\nafford to let the Astros beat us.\"  He then winked and said: \"Well, maybe\\nDavis will get decked once.\"\\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\\nthe nastness of the Astros\\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It\\'s as if some three-year-old threw a\\ntantrum and told his playmates: \\'If I can\\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit\\nhome runs\\',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\\nAstros didn\\'t score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\\n     \"They\\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\\'ve got to be ready to\\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We\\'ll go with\\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers\\'\\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\\n     \"We\\'re mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\\nplays can do it now and then.  We\\'re sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\\nguess that\\'s why they\\'re so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The \\'Stros\\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\\n     Standings after these weekend series:\\nA.L.East\\nTeam                     W           L           GB\\nNew York                68        42          --\\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\\nDetroit                 64        46           4\\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\\nWashington              39         73          28\\n\\nA.L.West\\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\\nMinnesota               61         48            1\\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\\nCalifornia              57         56            8\\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\\n\\nN.L.East\\nChicago          57         53                --\\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\\nNew York         48         64               10\\n\\nN.L.West\\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\\nHouston          50          61               17.5\\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5\\n-- \\nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, \\'cause Heaven is just a great\\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\\n',\n",

Also the Mets (my other least \\nfavorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a \\ngreat start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.\\n\\nBig Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be\\nhitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots\\nof hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on\\nsituational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower\\nthis year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and\\nLankford and Zeile\\'s off year).\\n\\nI don\\'t know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the \\nFilly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  \\nGive the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games \\nand we\\'ll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching \\nstaff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the\\ndifference.\\n\\nOn a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some \\nbaseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked \\nwhere to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied \"Fair.\"  I \\nremember it being in the \"They Said It\" section of Sports Illustrated.\\nI would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.\\n\\nGO REDBIRDS!!\\n\\nGary Wieman\\n',\n",

As a result, I think I get more\\nthan my fair share of borderline calls at the plate, because I have a\\nrep of having a good eye.

His\\n1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to\\nthird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,\\nhe began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.\\n\\nBut no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye\\nover the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,\\nhe was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came\\nup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through\\n2 position changes in the space of a year.  He\\'s an adequate OF,\\nalthough not great, and at least some of your perception of his\\nfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the\\nML level.  (I know you\\'re another long-term Braves fan :)\\n\\nAbout playing 3B...IMO, that\\'s the 2nd most DIFFICULT position\\nto field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and \\nspeed, but at 3B, you\\'ve got to have quick reflexes and have \\na GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when\\nplaying sandlot softball!  Granted, I\\'d still put my best\\noverall infielder at SS, but that\\'s because he gets more\\nchances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me\\nthat so many teams have tried to convert other position players\\nto 3B.  But maybe that\\'s because the supply of \"natural\" 3B is\\nscarce.\\n\\nFinally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to\\nperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don\\'t get\\nthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a\\nlot of weight work.  Now, whether he\\'s been overdoing it these\\ndays may be a valid question, as is the question of whether\\nhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.\\nBut frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,\\nI\\'d much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not\\ntrying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation\\nto an adult; but at that age I don\\'t believe you can teach\\nhustle.\\n\\nAll that said, I don\\'t think I\\'d sign Gant to another long-term\\ncontract.  He\\'s 28 now, and I think he\\'s free-agent eligible\\nin 2 years, when he\\'ll be 30.  Given his career curve and\\nlimitations, I wouldn\\'t expect him to last much past 35\\nas a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta\\'s\\ngot some talent on the farm, and I\\'d rather take my chances\\ndown the road with Nieves et al.\\n\\nEric\\n',\n",

And enlightening.\\n\\nHere\\'s my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep \\'92, and Jose Canseco,\\ncirca June 1986.\\n\\n1.  He\\'s bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\\n    not gain more bulk.\\n\\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I\\'d say he\\'s\\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that\\'s a HUGE amount of speed.\\n\\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\\n    Canseco can\\'t.  Also, note that Canseco doesn\\'t always close his\\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\\n    they\\'re fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it\\'s hard\\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\\n\\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\\n\\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\\nso that I\\'d never have to work again, I\\'d restructure my entire swing.\\n\\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\\nthe bathead more freely.\\n\\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\\n\\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\\nthe park.\\n\\nIf Canseco\\'s open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\\nproblems, he\\'ll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\\nstill hit 600+ HR.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n*   Gary Huckabay   * \"You think that\\'s loud enough, a$$hole?\"           *\\n*   \"Movie Rights   * \"Well, if you\\'re having trouble hearing it, sir,   *\\n*   available thru  *  I\\'d be happy to turn it up for you.

Maybe Andres\\nhas a \"weak\" left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the\\nball.  Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - I dunno.

It appears that in\\na neutral park Bo\\'s HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\\n\\nOne thing, when looking at Bo\\'s stats, is that you can see that KC took\\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \\nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \\n\\n> That is good.

I thought he\\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \\nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t\\nwinning.\\n\\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\\nmistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group)\\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\\n\\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\\n\\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\\na player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe\\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean?\\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \\n\\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE\\'s.  But you guys DON\\'T KNOW.  What\\'s \\nworse, you don\\'t know that you don\\'t.  And you don\\'t know that there are \\nother players you won\\'t know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \\nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.

The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season.\\nLast season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted).\\nThis season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with more\\nat bats.  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better\\nhitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has been\\na better hitter in certain situations than Sabo.\\n\\nI did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get a\\nhit.  I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager (or\\neven a Reds fan) that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that\\nsituation than Sabo.\\n\\n\\n>>If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time, I assume you\\n>>would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch-\\n>>hitting Samuel.

No better than a coin toss.\\nI actually *do* accept your work.\\n\\nAs it happens, I also have an *opinion* that in certain situations,\\nfor certain players, a history of superior or inferior ability to\\nhit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be\\nvalid in projecting future player performance.  For that player.\\nAnd Chris Sabo is one such player.\\n\\n\\n>So tell me?  Does the term fit?

Olson was still\\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\\n\\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\\nand Berryhill couldn\\'t hit their way out of a wet cardboard\\nbox, and don\\'t walk enough to be useful.\\n\\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\\nat the start of the season, he wouldn\\'t have gotten his job back.\\n\\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\\nPlus, you\\'d have to eat that salary, which isn\\'t huge, but isn\\'t\\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson\\'s at about $800,000, Berryhill\\nat $450,000, but that\\'s only what I recall).\\n\\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\\naren\\'t eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\\n\\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn\\'t on the team.\\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\\nand the truth is that I\\'d rather see our best team on the field,\\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\\n\\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won\\'t need him. ;)\\n\\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\\nlike this:  (Remember, they\\'ve BOTH been GM\\'s)\\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\\n\\nCox:  OK, we\\'ve sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\\nis better than it used to be.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\\njust won\\'t sign that baseball only contract.  We can\\'t count\\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman\\'s not ready to give up on\\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher\\'s gone AND Deion signs,\\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\\n\\nCox:  Yep, that\\'ll be nice.  Too bad Deion won\\'t sign.\\nOK, I\\'ll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\\nKlesko?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ve still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\\nbut somehow he doesn\\'t seem to be the same GM.  First\\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I\\'d HAVE to believe that he\\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\\n\\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I\\'ll wait til the trading\\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\\nAnd if that doesn\\'t work, then perhaps Sid\\'s knees\\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There\\'s always the\\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\\n\\nCox:  Well, he\\'s not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\\nin Richmond, he\\'ll start walking more.  Besides, if he\\'s going to be\\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Now, let\\'s see.  That leaves Lopez.\\n\\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn\\'t think Olson\\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\\nrunning into him again?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he\\'ll get\\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson\\'s shown his stuff a little\\nbit, I can\\'t trade him.  Besides, Berryhill\\'s a left-handed\\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\\n\\nCox:  Don\\'t you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you\\'re the one who wouldn\\'t write Lopez\\ninto the lineup.\\n\\nCox:  Well, you\\'re the one who went out and got me Jeff\\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn\\'t be used\\nto our pitching staff\\'s stuff.  He got some time with\\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\\nwill be hurt by May.\\n\\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.

My\\n*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently\\n(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might\\nbe able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players\\n(as opposed to all baseball players).\\n\\n  As a counterexample to \\n>what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\\n>\\n>               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\\n>               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\\n> \\n>Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\\n>Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\\n>\\n>If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\\n>situations, you\\'d bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \\n>1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\\n>hit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \\n>completely cooking the data,\\n\\nYou won\\'t hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interesting\\nthat you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also \\nlooked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA),\\nhitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has\\nbeen traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting \\nrecord is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would\\nnot draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based\\non his prior performance.  I don\\'t know how I would have felt in 1988,\\nbut you may indeed be right.  \\n\\nWhen I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and\\na more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately\\nbelow his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter.\\n\\nThis probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\\nwith others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical\\nhistory be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before\\nit has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\\nstatistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\\n\\n\\n>BTW, correlating players\\' _overall_ batting average from \\'84-\\'87 with\\n>\\'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\\n>something better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\\n>(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \\n>0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\\n\\nI completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find\\nthe same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent\\nbasis? \\n\\n>Actually, it\\'s technically incorrect to say that we can\\'t predict future\\n>clutch performance.  It\\'s more correct to say that we can\\'t predict\\n>future clutch performance with any skill.\\n>\\namen.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\n-- \\nMark Singer    \\nmss@netcom.com\\n',\n",

He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In\\ncase anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe\\nRuth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan\\nGonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that \\nhe had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record\\nbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I \\nam wrong.  \\n\\tOnto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I\\ncan't get McPaper consistently around here.  \\ncomment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals\\nthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could \\nhit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish\\nwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  \\nleadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm \\nlucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals\\nalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I\\nhaven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going\\nto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this\\nyear is stealing bases.\\nSheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.\\nWitness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,\\nor anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.\\nAndy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is \\nthis a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone \\nseen him pitch the two good games?\\nscore for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6.  Padres sweep the\\nCardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.

Sci., Urbana, IL\\nLines: 117\\n\\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\\nStillwell would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kurt\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt\\'s 57.6% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Double\\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n1.015 Sandberg\\n .865 Alicea\\n .852 Thompson\\n .755 DeShields\\n .705 Doran\\n .678 *NL Average*\\n .656 Biggio\\n .602 Harris\\n .582 Randolph\\n .580 Morandini\\n .573 Lemke\\n .571 Lind\\n .336 Stillwell\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.838 Baerga\\n.812 Alomar\\n.811 Fletcher\\n.806 Whitaker\\n.757 Blankenship\\n.725 Miller\\n.718 Knoblauch\\n.708 Reed\\n.704 Bordick\\n.691 *AL Average*\\n.636 Kelly\\n.631 Ripken\\n.603 Reynolds\\n.602 Sojo\\n.555 Sax\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

A \\nplayer\\'s batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.\\nA player\\'s ability to walk or infielder\\'s Defensive Average are correlated\\nbetter.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics\\nwe can have a pretty good handle on how they\\'ll do next year.  Put in \\nsome simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of \\nthe basic problems with something like \"clutch\" batting average - overall\\nbatting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. \\nAdding to the sample size doesn\\'t seem to help much.  As a counterexample to \\nwhat you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\\n\\n               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\\n               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\\n \\nMaldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\\nLemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\\n\\nIf you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\\nsituations, you\\'d bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \\n1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\\nhit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \\ncompletely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ \"clutch\"\\nat bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple\\nmeasure of clutchness, let\\'s just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use \\n\\'84-\\'87 to predict \\'88 for those 96 players, you\\'d find that 27 of the\\n96 were below league average in that measure both in \\'84-87 and in \\'88,\\n26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were \\nabove in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,\\nyou\\'d expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The\\ndifference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment\\nis not statisically significant.\\n\\nBTW, correlating players\\' _overall_ batting average from \\'84-\\'87 with\\n\\'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\\nsomething better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\\n(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \\n0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\\n\\n>\\n>\\n>>       Everyone would agree (I hope) that a grand \\n>>\\tslam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three\\n>>\\tis a VERY clutch hit.

There\\'s a lot of \"dead time\" with the\\nplayers warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the\\nmound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher\\nwho then takes (8? 10?) pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ (Dodger fans\\nwill appreciate that one).  To the non baseball junkie this is boring.\\nAt any rate, I\\'m not putting baseball down for this - I\\'ve been an avid\\nfan since I can remember - it\\'s just that watching a baseball game on\\nT.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie.  That\\'s what Major\\nLeague Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of\\nshortening the game.

I\\nwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.\\n\\n2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an\\nimpressive win last week. NOw Otto\\'s latest debacle has restored Simmon\\'s\\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his \\'92 form when he had the\\nAL\\'s highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted\\'s sake), I hope he\\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\\n\\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\\nthe plate in his rookie year.\\n\\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\\nWalk desrved his contract.\\n\\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\\ncan\\'t understand his and management\\'s fear of losing Tom Prince through\\nwaivers. Even if they do, what\\'s the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\\npitching). Didn\\'t Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\\nwasn\\'t very fit last year.\\n\\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\\non Patterson in stead.\\n\\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn\\'t been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\\n\\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn\\'t given a contract extension last year? NOw his\\nvalue has increased immensely.\\n\\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\\nLet\\'s see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won\\'t be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\\n\\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon\\'s tenure was\\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\\n\\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\\nnothing else will.\\n\\nOn a final note.

The Mariners\\nhad the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the\\nfielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.  \\n\\nNow, without a judgement call (and I don\\'t think there is one), this is an RBI\\nfor the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be \"defensive\\nindifference\", since it doesn\\'t really matter whether the guy at third scores\\nat that point.  (I know, I can think of several \"If the Mariners stole third\\nand second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a\\ngrounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and\\nthird, he wouldn\\'t have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and\\nmaybe he therefore can\\'t make the throw to first to get the last out, etc...\\nscenarios, too.  But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when\\nyou\\'re down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)\\n\\nThe point is that the batter (IMO) shouldn\\'t get \"credit\" (an RBI) for utterly\\nfailing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not\\ntrade an out for one run.

Sci., Urbana, IL\\nLines: 118\\n\\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Juan\\nGonzalez would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Juan\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin\\'s 55.4% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Extra \\nBases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.

The Twins took two of three games in the series,\\nwith scores as follows:\\n\\n                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10\\n                                        Mil  0\\n                   Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0)  \\n\\n                  Wednesday April 21st  Mil 10  (10)\\n                                        MN   8\\n                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )\\n\\n                  Thursday April 22nd   MN  5\\n                                        Mil 4\\n                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)\\n                    Sa - Aguilera\\n\\nHighlight/Low Lights of the Series:\\n------------------------------------\\nJim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of\\nthe American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0\\nwith a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning\\nhis ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with\\nPhiladelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail\\nlook like a true genius.\\n\\nWillie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings\\non Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now \\ncombine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are\\n0-5.\\n\\nWednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the\\nTwins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and \\nsubsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead\\nto 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing\\n4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.\\nTapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike\\nHartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and\\nthe Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win\\nit.\\n\\nAguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown\\nsaves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.\\nComing into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,\\nthen hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the\\nside.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.\\nWeak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.\\n\\nGeneral News\\n-------------------------------------\\nPedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on\\nTuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,\\nthough, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former\\nGopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.\\n\\nThe Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting\\nPitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit\\nTigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide \\nquite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.\\n\\nThe Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,\\nthe third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.\\n\\nBrian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second\\nthis year, and shows much improvement in this category.\\n\\nJim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he \\nhas the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch\\nout of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 \\nstart.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly\\nin response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the\\nrubber on the pick-off move.\\n\\n\\nCurrent MLB AL West Standings( from Joesph Hernandez, jtchern@ocb.berkeley.edu  )\\n\\nAMERICAN WEST         Won  Lost   Pct.

Guy didn\\'t hit a lick, had\\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don\\'t \\nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn\\'t field,\\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\\nOBP wasn\\'t THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \\n\\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80\\'s.  I know that\\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn\\'t overrated by the media.  \\n\\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one\\'s actually pretty close.  He\\'s had a s\\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \\n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I\\'d have to take a closer look at the stats (it\\'s been \\na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \\n\\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn\\'t mean a whole hell of a lot if you \\nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \\nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \\nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\\n\\tDarrell Evans?

Big deal.\\n>Let\\'s be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so\\n>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something\\n\\n\\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he\\'s won something along\\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \\ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie\\'s more\\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\\n80\\'s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie\\'s\\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against Tom Niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  His \\'82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\\nSS numbers go.

When \\n>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential \\n>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to\\n>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?\\n\\n\\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you\\'re right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn\\'t be in the HOF.\\n\\tSkyJack?  I\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout Morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  Morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he\\'s \\njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\\n(Of course, Nolan\\'s a HOF\\'er...)\\n\\tPuck?  Probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the HOF, most\\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \\ntragic or sudden).  He\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  I\\'ve always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.

Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above\\nor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from \\nthe mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.\\nIn the four years (\\'84-\\'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there\\nwere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch \\nsituations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of\\nthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two\\nyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and\\nreally horrible the other year.

The\\n\\treporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he\\n\\tgave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with\\n\\tthe fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that\\n\\tspeak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not\\n\\tthe) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac\\n\\tMcCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his\\n\\tbook, _All The Pretty Horses_.

Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark: Cal\\nRipken for his 1984 season. Rounding out the top five offensive players\\nin the NL last season: Sheffield, 5.9; Sandberg, 5.8; Van Slyke, 5.3; and\\nLarkin, 4.7.\\n\\nThe top 5 offensive players in the AL in 1992 were: E. Martinez, 4.8;\\nVentura, 4.8; Anderson, 4.5; R. Henderson, 4.4; and Thomas, 4.4\\n\\nIn short, Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons\\never in the game's history -- better than any year had by Mantle,\\nMays, Williams, etc. (If you disagree, don't flame me; flame the\\nwriters of Total Baseball.) Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and\\nneck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one\\nhad the better year can be considered a toss-up. Thus, Total Baseball\\nsupports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of 1992.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\n--------------------------\\nPhil Brown                |\\naka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |\\n--------------------------\\n\",\n",

I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n>Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first;\\n>about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with\\n>the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score\\n>tied, for another .22.  And, finally, in the ninth to win the game by a score\\n>of 7-6, for a value of 0.5.  Bob hit 4 solo HR in 4 plate appearances, and\\n>was credited by your method with .12 + .14 + .22 + .5 = .98.  But what does\\n>that mean?  Was Bob 98% responsible for the win?  Certainly not; the defense\\n>is *always* 50% responsible (if you include pitching in that), and Bob wasn\\'t\\n>pitching.  In fact, Bob was only 4/7 of the offense (which is a lot, but not\\n>even close to 100%).  Furthermore, what about the other 3 team runs?  Say\\n>they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game,\\n>which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will\\n>himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have\\n>amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There\\'s clearly a problem here.\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n>>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the\\n>>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs\\n>>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming.\\n>>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough.\\n>\\n>In another article, I proposed a test of this.  We can predict a team\\'s \\n>won/lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs *total* they\\n>score and allow, without regard to when those runs score in the game.  If\\n>late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at\\n>late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n>Here\\'s another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What\\n>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost\\n>exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.\\n>Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with\\n>no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who \\n>scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.\\n>\\n>Does this make sense?\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?  They were probably about the same.\\n\\n                                                        Brian Smith\\n',\n",

I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers.

I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame.

And that\\n>is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\\n\\nThere\\'s an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball\\nteam and some people\\'s conception of a biological organism.  In the\\nbiology context, we would very likely read \"fitness\" for \"the score of\\nthe game\" and \"organisms\" for \"teams\".  How we interpret \"players\" is\\ntrickier, but either \"organs\", or \"genes\" might seem reasonable\\nchoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A \"genes\"\\ninterpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, \\nbut that would be a different and probably longer post.\\n\\nIf, however, we take the \"organ\" view, then our knowledge of biology\\nshould make us pause before we start saying things like \"species X is\\nmore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z\".  Given what we\\nknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious\\nof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often\\nmade when you map \"species X\" onto \\'humans\\', and \"organ Z\" onto\\n\\'brain\\').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. \\'brain\\'\\nabove might be more reasonable than \\'pancreas\\' assuming no gross\\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\\n\\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\\n\\n>To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\n>solutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B\\n>in their lineup.

But, of\\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\\n\\n>If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens\\n>has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a\\n>criteria, then fine.\\n\\nIn this cases, we\\'re seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\\n\\n>But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the\\n>individual\\'s contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only\\n>measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.\\n\\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\\nit\\'s unclear what it all really means.\\n\\n***\\n\\nNow just one more un-related point:\\n\\n>I have yet to see that any of you can predict a\\n>WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\\n\\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren\\'t the only difference\\nbetween the winners and the losers.\\n\\nMoreover, you\\'ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\\n\\n>The stats are a nice hobby and that\\'s about it.  There is no new\\n>knowledge being produced.  \\n\\nSince stats are summaries of events, it\\'s true that if you know the\\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\\nuseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge\\nin a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge\\neven though I\\'m relying on stats to do it.\\n\\njking\\n\\n',\n",

There are two big problems:\\n\\n\\t1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike\\n\\t  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an\\n\\t  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem\\n \\t  to have no clue about any team that doesn\\'t play on\\n\\t  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20\\n\\t  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the\\n\\t  country. It\\'s very rare to hear an out-of-town score\\n\\t  being reported on WIP.\\n\\n\\t2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss\\n\\t  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have\\n\\t  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.\\n\\t  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely\\n\\t  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.\\n\\nAnyway, that\\'s my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.\\n\\n-Alan\\n',\n",

Being me, of course, I\\nused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,\\nand I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent\\naverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I\\ncompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and\\nhere\\'s why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the\\nsystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above\\nreplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;\\n1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks\\nsubstantially right.\\n\\nIn the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I\\nhad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of\\n.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is\\n\"Billy Ripken\". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the\\nsame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I\\nhave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs\\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded\\noff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:\\nRandy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo\\nGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)\\nin left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.\\n\\nSo, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and\\nfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of\\nbatting outs, like 400.

I suspect that a comment like \"I enjoy hitting fourth; I\\'m\\nused to it\" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if\\nit came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying,\\n\"I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best\\nin that role.\"  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems like\\na fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question \\nlike, \"How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?\"\\nA more media-sensitive player might answer \"The manager knows what he is\\ndoing.

If I were Darryl, I\\'d probably answer that\\nquestion, \"The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get\\npaid for RBIs.  I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willing\\nto hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team.\"  or something like\\nthat.  It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was\\nhitting third--and make him sound like a \"team\" player.  Since Strawberry\\nwill not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for\\nhis next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help   \\nhis image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.\\n\\nRemember, the media is of the belief that one\\'s best RBI man should hit\\nfourth, so the argument is sensible, regardless of whether or not it is\\ntrue.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Jeff\\n',\n",

While\\nI\\'m all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples\\nof rampant Hargroving, there was a difference here.\\n\\n1)  Since time immemorial, batters have complained about calls.\\nSo have pitchers and catchers.  Usually, nothing happens.\\nUnless the league notified teams this year about not allowing\\ncomplaints, Hirschbeck was acting against expectations.\\n\\n2)  It\\'s not as if Gant was \"in Hirschbeck\\'s face\".  Gant said\\nsomething about the call, stepped out of the box, and turned away\\nfrom Hirschbeck.  As a hitter (alibet of little consequence, but\\nwith a decent eye), whenever receiving the short end of the stick\\non a questionable call, I\\'d want a moment or two out of the box,\\nif for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on\\nthe experience of the last pitch.  And if I was really angry\\nat the ump, I\\'d rather turn away and catch my breath than\\nturn to him and say something that might get me tossed,\\nespecially at a key moment in the game.\\n\\nWhen Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant\\nto step into the box.  IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeck\\nwas determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game.\\nGant wasn\\'t dawdling; he hadn\\'t had a chance to dawdle.  And Hirschbeck\\nwas simply exercising a power play.  Gant resisted, as many of\\nus might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, and\\nHirschbeck called for the pitch.  At that point, Cox came out on\\nthe field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left the\\ndugout.  Cox was tossed \"protecting his player\".  I was pleasantly\\nsurprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.\\n\\nIt\\'s a small sample size, but based on what I saw in that game,\\nMark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play\\nGod on the field.  Not good qualities for an umpire.

He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\\nthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\\nclear that up is playing and practice time.

Olsen  and\\nBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\\nthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost\\nall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn\\nthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to\\nlearn Tom Glavine\\'s pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn\\'t\\nbe supprised if the pitcher\\'s claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over\\npitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But \\ngiven time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.\\n\\n\\tNow, since Lopez can\\'t learn how to handle the major league\\npitcher\\'s while he\\'s in AAA and since he doesn\\'t have any glaring\\nproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he\\ncan\\'t learn just as well while in the majors?  \\n\\nDave\\n__________\\nDave Bonar\\nmebonar@lsuvax.sncc.lsu.edu\\n__________\\n\\n',\n",

I doubt if anyone\\nwatching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an\\nopportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that\\nwas present.  I would be totally opposed to any effort that would\\neliminate that aspect of baseball.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful\\nenough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they\\nare actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games \\nout the way that they do.

       " u'From: sam@steamer.clam.com (Sam Mandelbaum)\\nSubject: Yankee Thoughts\\nOrganization: CLaM Associates, Cambridge, MA 02141\\nLines: 76\\n\\n\\nYes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are \\nfinally moving in the right direction.  They should finish\\nover .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race \\nin August.  However, I would take back a few moves:\\n\\n1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.\\n    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a\\n    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year, \\n    but he won\\'t because the right side of the Yanks infield\\n    isn\\'t good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?  \\n    JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and\\n    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on \\n    the Angels?  I know it\\'s early, but if you\\'ve seen this kid\\n    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be \\n    a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What\\n    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it\\'s great that the Yanks\\n    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he\\'s 10 years\\n    older than Snow and just doesn\\'t have the same bat speed as\\n    before his back injury.  It\\'s a shame, but as a Yankee fan \\n    who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I\\'d take \\n    Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two\\n    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with\\n    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling\\n    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts\\n    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George\\n    forced this trade because he believes (and he\\'s right) that\\n    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I\\'d like to see the\\n    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.\\n\\n2.  Wade Boggs.\\n    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is \\n    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop\\n    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).\\n    Besides, Wade just doesn\\'t have any range.  What a shame about\\n    Charlie Hayes, huh?\\n\\n3.  Spike Owen.\\n    See Wade Boggs.  I\\'d much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri\\n    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is\\n    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys\\n    are on the down sides of their careers.\\n\\n4.  Danny Tartabull.\\n    Yes - he\\'s put up some tremendous numbers and it\\'s nice to think\\n    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he\\n    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,\\n    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O\\'Neil is playing\\n    left field!  I believe O\\'Neil led NL outfielders in assists\\n    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right\\ndirection but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should\\n(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This\\nmeans getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they \\nwill be ready in a year or two.  \\n\\nI\\'m afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.\\nCertainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is\\nplanning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world\\nseries now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any\\ntime (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,\\nthen add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep\\nthem).  Let\\'s all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn\\'t dismantle\\nthe terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee\\norganization back into one of respect.  I\\'m really afraid that he will\\ntrade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for\\nexample).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is\\nstill one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all\\nenjoy the future.  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it\\'s baseball\\nhell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!\\n\\nSam \"I\\'m not Militello or Millitello\" Mandelbaum.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Suppose we have a large population\\nof people who play this game every week.\\n\\nIn the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population\\nwill win 7 or more times.\\n\\nIn the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again\\nbe 7-time winners.\\n\\nIn the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in\\neach of the first two years will win 7 again.\\n\\nSuppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three\\nyears, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last\\nthree years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.\\n\\nDo we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?\\nNo.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these\\n\"consistent winners\" can influence their chances of winning.  But\\nsuppose we *don\\'t* know whether or not there is a chance that skill\\nmight be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are\\npsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?\\n\\nWe can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the\\npopulation will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a\\nhigh positive correlation (even if they aren\\'t very good psychics,\\nthey should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net\\nresult?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.\\n\\n>This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\\n>with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical\\n>history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before\\n>it has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\\n>statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\\n\\nWell, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has\\nhit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at\\nthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse\\nas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn\\'t\\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\\n\\nNow if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true\\nto form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn\\'t\\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks\\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You\\nlook at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more\\nlikely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at\\nthose numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to\\nbe clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\\nway.\\n\\n>I completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find\\n>the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent\\n>basis? \\n\\nThen we would have something useful.  And we would also have a\\npositive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a\\npattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern\\nand then reverses.\\n\\nCheers,\\n-Valentine\\n',\n",

At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\\n\\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\nsolutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B\\nin their lineup.

But you\\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\\nindividual\\'s  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\\nonly measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\\njective  and  is  mere opinion.

I would rather have the untried\\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\\nhimself to be average at best. I don\\'t care if he is 15; if he plays\\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I\\'ll admit). Santiago\\'s\\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy\\'s, but I don\\'t have\\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\\n\\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\\n.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on\\nthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was\\njust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87.

You\\ncan call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their\\ndatabase, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course.

Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he\\'d\\nbe a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year.

Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and \\noften by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some\\nrecently rare power with their bats.\\n\\nBelcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the\\ngame progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those\\nwere few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while\\nstriking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working\\nfor him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on \\nbreaking balls.\\n\\nTomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch\\ndouble to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and \\nBarry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys\\n(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact\\nthey all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal\\nand a Tomlin wild pitch.\\n\\nIn fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky\\nstart-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only\\n2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was\\npoorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would \\nlater score on Reggie Sanders\\' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead \\nafter 4.\\n\\nThe fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second\\ndouble of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the \\nleft field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on\\nTom Prince\\'s two-base passed ball.  \\n\\nThe Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the\\nfifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second \\nbeing of the \"bunt\" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a \\nfoul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith \"K\\'d\" to end any Pittsburgh hope.\\n\\nPittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,\\nMoeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings\\nwork.\\n\\nBarry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played \\nbruised his right thumb.

You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long \\nas you want, IF he\\'s still certified as injured.  The player must be \\nperiodically re-evaluated to determine if he\\'s still injured (thus you \\ncannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not \\nwish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day \\nthat reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I \\nbelieve, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.

Sci., Urbana, IL\\nLines: 105\\n\\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kevin\\nBass would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kevin\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin\\'s 49.4% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Extra \\nBases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.

Trionfo)\\nSubject: Re: WFAN\\nOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio (USA)\\nLines: 92\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: hela.ins.cwru.edu\\n\\n\\n    I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment\\nof WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to\\nboth stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike\\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \\nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \\nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \\n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\\nMorning show:\\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \\nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\\nit was a major story.\\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\\nstyles of host.\\n\\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \\nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \\nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \\'guys\\')\\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \\neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\\nyou can\\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\\n\\n2PM to 4PM:\\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \\nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\\nare often hilarious.  \\n\\n4 PM to 7 PM:\\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\\nMike Missanelli but I just can\\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.  \\nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\\nhomer now.  I don\\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \\nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\\n\\n7 PM to Midnight:\\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\\nJets, or St. John\\'s basketball.  If the game is on the\\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\\nDuring the summer, it\\nis all talk on WIP.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \\n\\n\\n\\n            Rich\\n-- \\n  \"You\\'ve read the hat, now see the movie.\"\\n                   -Imus in the morning \\n  \"A blurb?

Although the\\n*average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left\\nfielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly\\nlower; if you are a left fielder but can\\'t hit well enough to keep a job\\nanywhere, then you certainly can\\'t hit well enough to keep a job at DH.\\n\\n\\n--\\nDavid Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu\\n\"We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.\"\\n\"Please rotate your phone 90 degrees and try again.\"\\nDisclaimer: I speak for no one and no one speaks for me.\\n',\n",

       " u\"From: mss@netcom.com (Mark Singer)\\nSubject: Darrrrrrrrryl\\nOrganization: Netcom Online Communications Services (408-241-9760 login: guest)\\nLines: 64\\n\\n\\n\\nThe media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to\\ndeath, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.\\n\\nGerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two\\non and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the\\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\\n\\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\\n\\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \\nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\\nthe catch.\\n\\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \\nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\\nimpossible.\\n\\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\\nnine games.\\n\\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\\n\\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\\nof the fan.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nMark Singer    \\nmss@netcom.com\\n\"]"
